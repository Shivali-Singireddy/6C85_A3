				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The number of new COVID-19 cases follows a cyclical pattern, with noticeable peaks and troughs. For instance, the cases steadily rose until mid-January 2021, then dropped to near zero by mid-June. This was followed by another surge in September, followed by a slight decline. The most significant peak occurred in January 2022, marking the highest number of new cases observed during the entire period.</li>
				<li>Overall, outside of the cycles, there is an overarching upward trend in the number of new cases. The graph shows that each new year starts at the top of the cycle, and we can observe a significant rise in cases from January 2020 to January 2021. The same trend is evident from January 2021 to January 2022, indicating a year-over-year increase in new infections.</li>
				<li>The data also suggests a clear seasonal pattern, with case numbers peaking during the winter months, particularly in January. Conversely, summer months, especially June, tend to see a decrease in cases, highlighting a possible seasonal variation in virus transmission. This might mean that the transmitablity of the virus is affected by the weather.</li>
				<li>The data highlights a concerning trend in January 2022, where new cases surged to unprecedented levels, far surpassing previous years' trends. This sharp increase suggests that the virus may be becoming more infectious, which could raise significant public health concerns moving forward.</li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<ul>
				The graph effectively highlights year-to-year variations in new COVID-19 cases, making it easy to identify seasonal patterns and the cyclical nature of the virus. Specifically, it’s clear that summer months typically experience fewer cases, while winter months, particularly January, see a significant rise in infections. In general, this graph differs from the standard graphs typically found in research papers, which makes it challenging to pinpoint exact numbers. However, the trade-off is that this format effectively highlights the seasonality, making it much easier to spot seasonal trends at a glance. The use of dotted grey lines marking the months further increases the clarity of the graph by reducing the cognitive load needed to track the timeline. This makes it easier for the viewer to follow the progression of cases month by month. The graph also does not seem to have much clutter in it, which contributes to its simplicity and makes it easier to read. Adding more elements could disrupt this clarity, potentially overwhelming the audience and making it harder for them to know where to focus.

				<br>

				However, while the graph does a good job illustrating overall trends, it could better emphasize the article’s key point of Omicron’s increased transmissibility. The visualization seems to highlight the seasonality and cyclical nature of cases more, which might cause readers to originally miss the huge increase in new cases because of Omicron. Adding labels to draw attention to the dramatic increase in cases from January 2021 to 2022, or highlighting this in the graph with annotations, would make the message clearer. Since the intended audience is the general public, anyone who could potentially be affected by the virus, it’s crucial that the graph immediately communicates the key takeaway. Additionally, the graph leaves some ambiguity regarding the exact number of cases in each month. While a legend shows a range of 0 to 150K, it’s unclear whether this represents the maximum number of cases or the size of the shaded area. Including more specific labels at key points and changing the legend to better represent the case numbers based on area in the graph would make the data easier to interpret and more informative for the viewer.

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to include a sketch similar to the original in terms of chart type while incorporating labels and making adjustments to clarify certain elements. In this way, I could directly implement the Feedback from the Design Critique and show exactly what parts I would change about this graphic to make it more understandable</li>
				<li>I added a title to this graph which includes the main takeaway in the title so the audience knows exactly the message they should take away from this visualization</li>
				<li>I also changed the area of the legend to be more reflective of the largest area in the graph. I also added labels for the area every three months so that the viewer would know exactly what the area was at each of the months and could reorient themselves to the correct approximation for area. When doing this, I realized that proportionally the area for January 2022 actually looked much smaller than the area of 800K that it was supposed to represent. Therefore, I changed the area to be bigger and more accurately reflect this drastic increase in weekly average of new COVID-19 cases. This change effectively emphasized the article’s key point that the Omicron variant caused an unprecedented surge in new cases. Overall, these modifications worked very well for the graph because they provided clear reference points and made it easier to compare the data across different years and seasons.</li>
				<li>I also included a box around the December 2021 - January 2022 area to draw the viewers attention to this part of the graph where the Omricon variant increases to a huge number. While I think this was good, I think the way I drew it made it look a little cluttered. Maybe including more space between January 2021 and January 2022 would make it look less cluttered. Additionally, I used a blue outline for the box to contrast the red, but upon reflection, I believe swapping the colors (making the shading blue and the box red) would have been more effective. Red is often used to signify urgency, which might have made the box stand out more clearly.</li>
				<li>For the next sketch, I would like to explore a different visual form which is a little more mainstream and easier for the general public to interpret.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In this visualization, I used a shaded line chart which is a more common visualization type and is easier for the general public to understand since it’s similar to what they’ve seen before.</li>
				<li>I changed the main topic of this visualization to instead reflect the key point that the Omicron variant is more Infectious, but it is also less deadly. I made this change because I felt that it better reflected the key takeaway from the article.</li>
				<li>I decided to use blue for new cases and red for deaths since red is seen as a more negative color and deaths are usually worse than new cases.</li>
				<li>I also shaded in the area under the graph because I wanted it to reflect that all of the people, in the area under the curve either had a new case of COVID-19 or died.</li>
				<li>I included labels at the end of the graph to show illustrate key points more clearly in words. One of these points is the same as Sketch 1 in that it highlights how the number of new cases has tripled since the last peak in January 2021. I also show that while the number of new cases has tripled, the number of deaths has actually gone down by about 50%. This shows the second half of the graph title in that while the variant is more infectious, it is actually less deadly.</li>
				<li>Overall, the graph is more interpretable on first glance to mainstream audiences and it clearly highlights the main points. Some things which do not work well in this graph however are that it is not as easy to see the cyclic nature of the disease and quickly notice how it peaks in the winter seasons and goes down in the summer seasons. The graph overall is also not the most creative, although its simplicity makes it easier to read.</li>
				<li>For the next sketch I would like to explore a more creative visualization which is not as mainstream, but is still able to get the main point across well</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In this visualization, I tried to be more creative and deviate away from the standard graphs. I used a calendar graphic, dividing each month by year and shading the corresponding side with varying shades of red to represent the average number of new COVID-19 cases for that month.</li>
				<li>One thing I hoped to highlight through this visualization was to highlight the seasonality aspect which was somewhat lost in the previous visualization. I hoped to this by grouping the different months. This seemed to work well Since the months of January, November and December were the darkest red, indicating higher case numbers, while the months of May and June were lighter, reflecting lower case numbers. Overall, this helped show the seasonality shifts and pinpoint the months where cases spiked significantly.</li>
				<li>I also like how the numbers were included in the visualization along with the shading. This helped quantify the impact, providing a clear and direct comparison, rather than relying on assumptions based on relative shading alone.</li>
				<li>The title of the plot was included in the title of the calendar and correlated with the black slashed box surrounding the month of January to highlight the 600K peak it had recently seen in January 2022. Since this was a key point in the article, I added the dotted black box around it to further emphasize its significance.</li>
				<li>While this approach is creative and effectively highlights the overall trend, it serves more as a summary and doesn't capture every data point, unlike the line graph. As a result, it may miss outliers or rapid changes in the data, such as a sudden peak followed by a sharp decline, which are not fully represented in this format.</li>
				<li>For the next sketch, I would like to explore a method that is able to capture more of the data as opposed to just a summary.</li>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        There are two aspects of the data that I am most effectively trying to communicate. The first is that the Omicron variant is the significantly more infectious than previous COVID-19 variants. The second is that while it is more infectious, it is less fatal. These were the two main points in the article, which is why I wanted both them to be highlighted in the visualization in front of the article. The top half of the visualization effectively communicates the first part of the message, while the bottom half of visualization effectively communicates the second part of the main idea. The reason I chose to include new deaths to new cases ratio is because a huge number of deaths might be a result of a huge number of new cases. Therefore, to understand how fatal the disease actually is, we should compare how many people it kills to the number of people it has infected. While it might kill a decent number of people, if it infects a lot more people than it kills, it is overall less fatal than previous variants. I chose to use the area plot with a line because line graphs are familiar to most people, making them easier to interpret. I chose an area plot instead of a simple line graph to visually represent the total impact of the data, as the area beneath the line reflects the cumulative number of new cases and the ratio, indicating how many people were affected at each point. To further emphasize this, I shaded the area. For color choices, I used red to represent the number of new cases and black for the deaths-to-new-cases ratio. Red is commonly associated with alerts or something requiring attention, which aligns with the urgency of new COVID-19 cases, while black is often linked to death, making it a fitting choice for the ratio of fatalities. The visualization does effectively show the main points of the article by including labels with arrows to visually illustrate the main points. To further highlight the second point, I added a blue line representing the average death-to-new-cases ratio, allowing for a direct comparison with the current ratio. This helps to clearly demonstrate that the current ratio is significantly lower than it was previously. I chose blue for the line because it contrasts effectively with the black and ensures the line stands out visually. One aspect that this visualization fails to capture is the cyclic nature of this data and the seasonal variation. However, I did not think that this was the main point of the article, which is why I chose the type of graph I did for user interpretability in understanding the main points of the article.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
		I believe that my final design does address some critiques surfaced in Step 2. It now does effectively emphasize the article’s main point, and even includes it in the title in case users are confused. The numbers are also much clearer now as there is y-axis legend whose lines are drawn across until the end of the x-axis. I actually really liked the “critique by redesign” approach because it effectively helped me identify challenges with communicating this data along with some design tensions and tradeoffs. Without taking time to analyze what worked well with the original graph and what didn’t I wouldn’t have been able to notice the pattern of seasonality in the original data, nor would I have accounted for it in potential redesigns. However, trying to understand why the graph designers chose this form of visualization helped bring this out to me, and made me more aware of the decisions I was making and what information I was losing. It also helped me see that as a designer, some patterns might seem obvious to me, but as a viewer, they might not be as obvious. This reminds me of the curse of knowledge, which is when you know that there is a pattern so your eyes are drawn to it, but your audience might not and as a result they might be confused by what you are trying highlight. To help avoid this, it can help to draw arrows or include some additional tool which can highlight the main point as well in case it is not immediately obvious to viewers.
