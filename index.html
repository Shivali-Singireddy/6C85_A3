				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The number of new COVID-19 cases follows a cyclical pattern, with noticeable peaks and troughs. For instance, the cases steadily rose until mid-January 2021, then dropped to near zero by mid-June. This was followed by another surge in September, followed by a slight decline. The most significant peak occurred in January 2022, marking the highest number of new cases observed during the entire period.</li>
				<li>Overall, outside of the cycles, there is an overarching upward trend in the number of new cases. The graph shows that each new year starts at the top of the cycle, and we can observe a significant rise in cases from January 2020 to January 2021. The same trend is evident from January 2021 to January 2022, indicating a year-over-year increase in new infections.</li>
				<li>The data also suggests a clear seasonal pattern, with case numbers peaking during the winter months, particularly in January. Conversely, summer months, especially June, tend to see a decrease in cases, highlighting a possible seasonal variation in virus transmission. This might mean that the transmitablity of the virus is affected by the weather.</li>
				<li>The data highlights a concerning trend in January 2022, where new cases surged to unprecedented levels, far surpassing previous years' trends. This sharp increase suggests that the virus may be becoming more infectious, which could raise significant public health concerns moving forward.</li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<ul>
				The graph effectively highlights year-to-year variations in new COVID-19 cases, making it easy to identify seasonal patterns and the cyclical nature of the virus. Specifically, it’s clear that summer months typically experience fewer cases, while winter months, particularly January, see a significant rise in infections. In general, this graph differs from the standard graphs typically found in research papers, which makes it challenging to pinpoint exact numbers. However, the trade-off is that this format effectively highlights the seasonality, making it much easier to spot seasonal trends at a glance. The use of dotted grey lines marking the months further increases the clarity of the graph by reducing the cognitive load needed to track the timeline. This makes it easier for the viewer to follow the progression of cases month by month. The graph also does not seem to have much clutter in it, which contributes to its simplicity and makes it easier to read. Adding more elements could disrupt this clarity, potentially overwhelming the audience and making it harder for them to know where to focus.

				However, while the graph does a good job illustrating overall trends, it could better emphasize the article’s key point of Omicron’s increased transmissibility. The visualization seems to highlight the seasonality and cyclical nature of cases more, which might cause readers to originally miss the huge increase in new cases because of Omicron. Adding labels to draw attention to the dramatic increase in cases from January 2021 to 2022, or highlighting this in the graph with annotations, would make the message clearer. Since the intended audience is the general public, anyone who could potentially be affected by the virus, it’s crucial that the graph immediately communicates the key takeaway. Additionally, the graph leaves some ambiguity regarding the exact number of cases in each month. While a legend shows a range of 0 to 150K, it’s unclear whether this represents the maximum number of cases or the size of the shaded area. Including more specific labels at key points and changing the legend to better represent the case numbers based on area in the graph would make the data easier to interpret and more informative for the viewer.

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to include a sketch similar to the original in terms of chart type while incorporating labels and making adjustments to clarify certain elements. In this way, I could directly implement the Feedback from the Design Critique and show exactly what parts I would change about this graphic to make it more understandable</li>
				<li>I added a title to this graph which includes the main takeaway in the title so the audience knows exactly the message they should take away from this visualization</li>
				<li>I also changed the area of the legend to be more reflective of the largest area in the graph. I also added labels for the area every three months so that the viewer would know exactly what the area was at each of the months and could reorient themselves to the correct approximation for area. When doing this, I realized that proportionally the area for January 2022 actually looked much smaller than the area of 800K that it was supposed to represent. Therefore, I changed the area to be bigger and more accurately reflect this drastic increase in weekly average of new COVID-19 cases. This change effectively emphasized the article’s key point that the Omicron variant caused an unprecedented surge in new cases. Overall, these modifications worked very well for the graph because they provided clear reference points and made it easier to compare the data across different years and seasons.</li>
				<li>I also included a box around the December 2021 - January 2022 area to draw the viewers attention to this part of the graph where the Omricon variant increases to a huge number. While I think this was good, I think the way I drew it made it look a little cluttered. Maybe including more space between January 2021 and January 2022 would make it look less cluttered. Additionally, I used a blue outline for the box to contrast the red, but upon reflection, I believe swapping the colors (making the shading blue and the box red) would have been more effective. Red is often used to signify urgency, which might have made the box stand out more clearly.</li>
				<li>For the next sketch, I would like to explore a different visual form which is a little more mainstream and easier for the general public to interpret.</li>
